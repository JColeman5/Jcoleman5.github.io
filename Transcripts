My name is Justin Coleman. I am from Jackson, MS and I am a graduating senior from Jim Hill High School. I will be attending Tougaloo College in the fall of 2016. Over my high school career, I participated in Varsity Football along with the advanced school choir. I finished my high school with a 3.93 GPA and graduated number five in my graduating class. I attend College Hill Missionary Baptist Church where I am a member of the Usher Ministry and I am a member of the Youth Ministry. I plan on going to medical school (University of Mississippi, Meharry Medical School, University of Florida, or University of California Los Angeles).
